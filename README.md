## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- FiveM Server
- MySQL Database
- oxmysql Resource
- Tebex Account (for payment processing)

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. Download TD-Store from your purchase source
2. Extract the files to your server's `resources` folder
3. Ensure oxmysql is installed and loaded **before** TD-Store

### Step 2: Database Setup

1. Import the `database.sql` file into your MySQL database
2. This creates all necessary tables for the store system
3. Verify the tables were created successfully

### Step 3: Resource Configuration

Add TD-Store to your `server.cfg`:

```cfg
# Ensure oxmysql loads first
ensure oxmysql
ensure td-store
```

### Step 4: Permissions Setup

Add these ACE permissions to your `server.cfg`:

```cfg
# Admin permissions
add_ace group.admin tdstore.admin allow

# Manager permissions  
add_ace group.manager tdstore.manager allow
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Server Configuration (`s_config.lua`)

The server configuration contains sensitive information and should be configured carefully:

#### Tebex Integration
```lua
SConfig.Tebex = {
    private_key = "YOUR_TEBEX_PRIVATE_KEY",
    public_token = "YOUR_TEBEX_PUBLIC_TOKEN", 
    project_id = "YOUR_TEBEX_PROJECT_ID",
    webhook_secret = "YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    webhook = {
        url = "http://your-server-ip:30120/webhook"
    }
}
```

#### Security Settings
```lua
SConfig.Security = {
    validateOwnershipOnEnter = true,
    allowPassengers = true,
    ejectUnauthorizedDrivers = true,
    maxVehiclesPerPlayer = 10,
    cooldownBetweenSpawns = 3,
    enableAntiCheat = true
}
```

#### Discord Webhook
```lua
SConfig.Discord = {
    enabled = true,
    webhookUrl = "YOUR_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL",
    serverName = "Your Server Name",
    logPurchases = true,
    logCreditPurchases = true,
    logUnauthorizedAccess = true
}
```

### Client Configuration (`c_config.lua`)

The client configuration contains non-sensitive settings:

#### General Settings
```lua
CConfig.Command = 'store'        -- Command to open store
CConfig.Keybind = 'F7'           -- Keybind to open store
CConfig.EnableKeybind = true     -- Enable/disable keybind
```

#### Vehicle Preview
```lua
CConfig.VehiclePreview = {
    dealershipCoords = vector3(-56.79, -1096.63, 25.42),
    vehicleSpawnCoords = vector3(-50.0, -1100.0, 25.5),
    cameraCoords = vector3(-45.0, -1095.0, 27.0),
    cameraRotation = vector3(-10.0, 0.0, 45.0)
}
```
